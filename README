Note: there are API changes from the previous version 0.02.

File::Wildcard->( path => $path) now expects a path not a regexp. You
are expected to pass in dots unescaped. You are also expected to pass
wildcards as the standard globbing wildcards '*' and '?'. This is 
different from version 0.02, which expected a regexp.

This is a bog standard install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

Please refer to the POD - perldoc File::Wildcard for information
on how to use this module.
